# âœ… Fluent Language - Development Milestones

This document tracks completed work as we build the Fluent programming language step by step.

---

## ðŸ“… Milestones Completed (as of now)

### âœ… Lexer
- Token types defined (keywords, literals, symbols)
- Position tracking for line and column
- Indentation-aware (INDENT/DEDENT/NEWLINE)
- Unit tests for valid tokens and error cases

### âœ… Grammar Spec
- Written in EBNF-style reference (`Fluent Grammar v0.1`)
- Covers expressions, function declarations, types, and match

### âœ… Design Manifesto
- Fluent Language Manifesto drafted
- Outlines philosophy: simplicity, types-as-models, expression-oriented

### âœ… Roadmap
- Phases 0â€“7 defined (Lexer â†’ LSP â†’ Deployment)
- Daily progress follows this roadmap

### âœ… AST Layer
- Core AST nodes defined in `fluent_ast.py`
- Covers: LetStmt, FnDecl, ExprStmt, Binary, Var, Number, String, MatchExpr, Boolean, etc.

### âœ… Parser
- Parses let bindings, literals, binary expressions, calls
- Parses function declarations, if/else, match expressions
- Supports precedence, nesting, and indentation blocks
- Unit tests cover edge cases and malformed syntax

### âœ… Interpreter (core)
- Environment model with parent scopes
- Evaluates:
  - let bindings and variable references
  - Binary, Var, Number, String, Boolean
  - if expressions with strict boolean enforcement
  - match expressions with wildcard and if branches
- Pretty printer for visualizing AST structure

### âœ… Interpreter (functions)
- Evaluates user-defined functions:
  - Supports FnDecl, parameter binding, and local scoping
  - Evaluates arguments and executes body in isolated environment
  - Returns final expression value
- Handles error cases:
  - Calling undefined functions
  - Incorrect argument count
- Full test coverage for function evaluation

### âœ… Built-in Functions
- `print(...)` and `len(...)` implemented
- Python-backed call dispatch via `BuiltInFunction`
- Tested with string inputs and error cases

### âœ… Return Statement Support
- Introduced `return` as a statement (AST node)
- Interpreter handles `Return` via internal `ReturnException`
- Functions now support early exits from conditionals or match arms
- Implicit return of last expression still works as default
- Unit tests verify early return and fallback logic

### âœ… Boolean Logic Support
- Added `true` and `false` literals to the language
- Introduced `and`, `or`, and `not` operators
  - Fully integrated into precedence-based parser
  - Short-circuiting semantics in the interpreter
- Implemented `Boolean` as a first-class AST node
- Unit tests for all logical combinations

### ðŸ§  Planned: Memory Management & Garbage Collection
- Fluent will adopt automatic memory management
- Early interpreter will rely on Python's GC
- Long-term options:
  - Tracing GC (default, easy to implement)
  - Reference counting with cycle detection
  - Ownership model for advanced safety/performance
- Future milestone will define the runtime memory model formally

---

## ðŸ§­ Next Steps
- Add list literals and indexing
- Type annotations for Booleans and Lists
- Start REPL interface or script runner
- Basic type-checking phase
- Define module system and imports
